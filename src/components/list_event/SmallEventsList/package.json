      "fullDescription": "On Saturday, February 29th at 10 am, there will be an excursion \"Pobazarim\" - a walk through the territory of the Carmel market (the market does not work) and the Kerem Taimanim quarter. It's no secret that Jews love to eat. And they like to eat well and abundantly. This is largely facilitated by the fact that Israel today is home to Jews who have come from more than a hundred countries. These are one hundred different \"cuisines\", thousands of recipes, hundreds of different seasonings, additives, and trade secrets. And if in our country some \"internal racism\" is still occasionally encountered - in the countries of dispersal, then at the table all these problems disappear. Therefore, there is no surprise at the stuffed fish on the table of Moroccan Jews or Jahnun, a Yemenite Jewish dish served for dinner in a Polish Jewish family. Romanians drink arak, Russians drink ouzo, and Greeks drink vodka. They all drink wine together. Food and wine unite Jews, just like their Great Book. This coming Saturday, February 29th, I want to invite you on a tour dedicated to food, the bazaar (well, where else do they buy food), Jews and ... the sea. Of course, it will not do without stories of war, politics and entertainment. We will walk through the Carmel Saturday Market and the Kerem Taimanim quarter of Yemeni Jews. The excursion is rare, experimental, I do not take it often. ",
      "place": "Clock Tower in Jaffa. At the crossroads at Falafelnaya. On the left side of the pier on Friday at 19.00. We will be glad to see you and your children (from 4 years old) and dogs (from 1 year old).",
